hello there, i'm kalsicum. the two main things that i like are systems programming and milk- *obviously*.

i usually work on random projects for my own personal use, but still feel free to open any issues, PRs or suggestions. i'll probably get back to them in around 1-2 days depending on if i check my email or not.

my goto programming language is `rust`, though i also like to program in `C`, `zig`, `haskell` and `nix` *(for nixos configurations and flakes)*.
i *do* also know `python`, `java` and `C#` *(though somewhat reluctantly)*.

i'm interested in low-level systems programming, operating systems, compilers & type theory, data-orientated design, functional programming, and game development.

### stuff i use *(you don't have to use the same, it's just what i currently use)*
